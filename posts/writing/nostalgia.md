A such unnerving peace when beginning to relearn that being alone is not unnatural, and that the pain had never existed without having agreed to the terms in prior. It is just made unscalably fearsome to face the same terms and not decide to reject them.
Looking back to memories where I feel nostalgic makes me wonder whether that is because I feel so low now--because never have I looked onto a prior memory with anything but longing to be taken back. Is what I live now but a distant memory to which I will wish to be transported back to?
I hope not; I hope I never feel lower than this. I hope I look back with pride in my resilience.
