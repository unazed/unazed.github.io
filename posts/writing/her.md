"You were once a beautiful young boy, with these desires absent from your wistful heart. Oh, the tragedy that must have befallen you to keel before me!"
These words she spoke--with little indignance--yet, with such sheer indomitable conviction that, with my final lapses of consciousness, I rose my eyes to meet hers. As, and even though my vision faded, I could not mistake the sight before me.
"You will leave this world, and though I may not revert the curses that you have left upon others, they may find solace in that I shall wait here until you do."
Stark, abyssal eyes met with mine, so devoid that, had my senses not abandoned me countless moments prior, then I may had thought I were looking into the eyes of a demon, of the worst kind. She gazed through my eyes as I did hers; I think that she'd hoped to find a soul with an essence still lingering behind mine, but I watched as her intent gaze softened, as she realized that all but these last breaths had been already carved from mine.
Those last words that she spoke echoed through the cavern left of my mind. I had accepted the terms by which I will depart a while before, but, even in this moment, against the darkness filled by a million voices and faces, of those that I left in tears--defiled, and alone--I sensed an unrequited comfort that I would die, seen--but undiscovered.
