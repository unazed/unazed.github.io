  <p>To think back on these golden memories, and to savour each last droplet of sustenance that they feed my ever-aging soul; it is a privilege that I honour with each moment of their thought that lapses on the quiet occasion where I may, once again, find myself lost in their nostalgia.
A beautiful, passionate flame burning within the child that shaped the man which writes these words. Oh, but I wish--if only one thing--that I could've reminded myself in those memories, that I was always on the path of which I was fated; and that those feelings of dissonance with society were but necessary to fulfill my understanding of the world today.
I could not ask for more from myself, since I did it so perfectly--but thin is the line that delineates those golden memories from those of today, and I should never dwell on them for too long out of fear that I should forget to continue living.</p>
