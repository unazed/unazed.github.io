  <p>Let it all go, and let it all leave; let it rot and wither, decay into ash and soot. I just dreamed that I could one day, before long, come to terms with how it all feels. I understand it all, but I still wish to depart from the minds and hearts of others. If it didn't feel like a burden to also wish that someone may tell me that I did something for them that no other could've, and so let me leave all with the sincerest graces that I have ever wanted.</p>
